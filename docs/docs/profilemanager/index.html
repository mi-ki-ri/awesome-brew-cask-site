<li>Firefox and other XULRunner applications store user settings and data in special folders, called profiles.    Firefox provides a built-in applet to manage these profiles, but it will eventually be going away (see bug 214675), so a new standalone Profile Manager application has been created, which works with any XULRunner application, and has many features not found in Firefox&rsquo;s built-in version.</li>
