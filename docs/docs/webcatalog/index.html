<li>WebCatalog lets you turn any web apps into desktop apps (also called site-specific browsers). Now, you can launch your favorite apps quickly in self-contained, distraction-free windows with the ability to switch between accounts and workspaces easily. Each app&rsquo;s data is stored separately, protecting you from cross-website trackers and preserving your privacy.</li>
