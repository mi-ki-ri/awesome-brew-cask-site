<li>A distributed data community for the next generation Web. Value-driven technology</li>
<li>The Internet is broken â€“ and we are using it to access and distribute all of human knowledge. Data monopolies hold and enclose upon personal &amp; public datasets, threatening universal access. To tackle this problem, between 2013 and 2015 we performed a series of design &amp; development sprints in collaboration with researchers, librarians, and civic technologists working to preserve the digital knowledge commons. Out of this research we built Dat, a distributed ledger &amp; peer-to-peer data sharing toolkit.</li>
