# Github Atom
- [Github Atom](https://atom.io/)
  -  A hackable text editor for the 21st Century
  - At GitHub, we’re building the text editor we’ve always wanted: hackable to the core, but approachable on the first day without ever touching a config file. We can’t wait to see what you build with it.
  - `brew cask install atom`
