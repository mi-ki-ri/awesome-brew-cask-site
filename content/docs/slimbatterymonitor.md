  - SlimBatteryMonitor displays a battery meter in the menu bar for laptop and UPS batteries. It uses the same information as Apple's system gauge, but allows you much more control over how the information is displayed. It can take up less space. Works with Mac OS X 10.2 or later.
  - `brew cask install slimbatterymonitor`
