  - ffWorks is a graphical front-end for FFmpeg, a command-line tool used to convert multimedia files between formats. The command line instructions can be very hard to masterunderstand, so ffWorks does all the hard work for you. This allows you to use FFmpeg without detailed command-line knowledge.
  - `brew cask install ff-works`
